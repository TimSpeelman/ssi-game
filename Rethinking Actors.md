Rethinking Actors

What concerns should be separated?

- The `ContentLibrary` can define:
    - Personas / Full actors
    - Actor types / images
- The User can pick one of these and define
    - A full actor
    - Override any field
    - When later editing, the link to the persona/template can be lost, which is fine
- The GameEngine can change the Actor's properties on the way.
